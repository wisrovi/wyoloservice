The dataset includes 232 images.
Stm32-multimeter are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
